# My first steps learning Python

In this repository I summarize most of the Python code I wrote back in 2018 when I first started to experiment with this language. Little that I know, I will use this language -- and not the one I learned at University (C, C++) -- for work.

# Running Environment
Back in 2018 the only working PC I had was this Acer notebook I bought back in 2009, almost 10yrs and operating just fine.

Unfortunately its end came in 2021, it won't start, probably the BIOS battery run out, or something else. The HDD still works though.

- OS: Debian Stretch
- PC: Acer aspire one Atom Proc/RAM 2GB
- Editor: Emacs
