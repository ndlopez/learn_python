# My first steps learning Python

In this repository I summarize most of the Python code I wrote back in 2018 when I first started to experiment with this language. Little that I know, I will use this language -- and not the one I learned at University (C, C++) -- for work.

## Basic

Dealing with strings, arrays, IO, graphics, etc.

## Intermediate

- Local Server: Flask

- GUI in Python

	- GTK 3.0
	- Tkinter
	- Qt (PyQt)


# Running Environment
Back in 2017 and 2018 the only working PC I had was this Acer notebook I bought back in 2009, almost 10yrs and operating just fine.

Unfortunately its end came in 2021, it won't start, probably the BIOS battery run out, or something else. The 160GB HDD still works though.

- OS: Debian 9
- PC: Sony vaio J-series, previously Acer aspire one Atom Proc/RAM 2GB
- Editor: Emacs
